# AI-Driven-Banking-Risk-Loan-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze banking risk, loan performance, and customer financial behavior. It includes KPIs such as Total Clients, Total Loan, Total Deposit, and Total Fees to support data-driven loan approval decisions.
📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Banking Risk & Performance Analysis
🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning in Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard and presenting insights through a professional report and presentation.

The objective of this project is to analyze banking customer data, evaluate loan and deposit performance, and generate actionable business insights using data-driven techniques.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains banking and client-related information, including:

Client ID and demographic details

Loan details (Bank Loan, Business Lending, Credit Card Balance)

Deposit details (Savings, Checking, Foreign Currency Accounts)

Fee structure and engagement timeline

Relationship and advisor information

The dataset consists of multiple interlinked tables connected using primary and foreign keys.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data loading and preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

DAX – KPI and calculated measures

Gamma – Professional presentation (PPT) creation

Microsoft Excel – Initial data review (if applicable)

🔄 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.

Inspected data structure, data types, and missing values.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed loan distribution, deposits, and customer engagement.

Identified trends, outliers, and patterns.

Visualized key financial metrics.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing values.

Created new features such as:

Engagement Days (using date difference)

Income Bands

Processing Fees

Standardized and structured the dataset for reporting.

4️⃣ Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Created interactive dashboards including:

Loan Analysis

Deposit Analysis

Customer Engagement Insights

KPI Summary Dashboard

Key KPIs:
